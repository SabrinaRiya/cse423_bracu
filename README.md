# Tower Shooting Defence Game

This repository contains a computer graphics project that implements a Tower Shooting Defence Game. The game consists of three levels, each increasing in difficulty, where the player's goal is to prevent characters from crossing the road or path.

## Game Description

In this game, characters move along a predefined path. If any character manages to cross the entire road without being attacked, the player loses. The player's objective is to stop these characters by attacking them before they reach the end of the road. If successfully attacked, the characters are defeated, or they automatically disappear, preventing them from crossing and thus allowing the player to progress.

### Levels

- **Level 1:** Introduction to the game mechanics with a relatively easier challenge.
- **Level 2:** Increased difficulty with faster and more challenging characters.
- **Level 3:** Hardest level where quick reflexes and strategic planning are crucial.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game:** [Describe how to start the game, any setup required, and controls if applicable.]

3. **Gameplay Mechanics:** Detail how the shooting mechanism works, any power-ups or upgrades available, and strategies to defeat characters efficiently.
